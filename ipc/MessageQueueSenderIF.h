//TODO: Actually, the definition of this ID to be a uint32_t is not ideal and breaks layering.

//MessageQueueMessage.
//Ideally, one would use the (current) object_id_t only, however, doing a lookup of queueIDs for every
//call does not sound ideal.
//In a first step, I'll circumvent the issue by not touching it, maybe in a second step.
//This also influences Interface design (getCommandQueue) and some other issues..

/**
 * @brief   This DLE Encoder (Data Link Encoder) can be used to encode and
 *          decode arbitrary data with ASCII control characters
 * @details
 * List of control codes:
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes
 *
 * This encoder can be used to achieve a basic transport layer when using
 * char based transmission systems.
 * The passed source stream is converted into a encoded stream by adding
 * a STX marker at the start of the stream and an ETX marker at the end of
 * the stream. Any STX, ETX, DLE and CR occurrences in the source stream can be
 * escaped by a DLE character. The encoder also replaces escaped control chars
 * by another char, so STX, ETX and CR should not appear anywhere in the actual
 * encoded data stream.
 *
 * When using a strictly char based reception of packets encoded with DLE,
 * STX can be used to notify a reader that actual data will start to arrive
 * while ETX can be used to notify the reader that the data has ended.

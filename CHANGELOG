## Changes from ASTP 0.0.1 to 1.0.0


### FreeRTOS OSAL

- vRequestContextSwitchFromISR is declared extern "C" so it can be defined in
a C file without issues

### Device Handler Base

- There is an additional `PERFORM_OPERATION` step for the device handler base. It is important
that DHB users adapt their polling sequence tables to perform this step. This steps allows for aclear distinction between operation and communication steps

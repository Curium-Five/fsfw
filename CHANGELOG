## Changes from ASTP 0.0.1 to 1.0.0


### FreeRTOS OSAL

- vRequestContextSwitchFromISR is declared extern "C" so it can be defined in
a C file without issues

### PUS Services

- It is now possible to change the message queue depth for the telecommand verification service (PUS1)
- The same is possible for the event reporting service (PUS5)
- PUS Health Service added, which allows to command and retrieve health via PUS packets

### Local Pool

- Interface of LocalPools has change. LocalPool is not a template anymore. Instead the size and bucket number of the pools per page and the number of pages are passed to the ctor instead of two ctor arguments and a template parameter

## Changes from ASTP 0.0.1 to 1.0.0

### Host OSAL

- Bugfix in MessageQueue, which caused the sender not to be set properly

### FreeRTOS OSAL

- vRequestContextSwitchFromISR is declared extern "C" so it can be defined in
a C file without issues

### PUS Services

- It is now possible to change the message queue depth for the telecommand verification service (PUS1)
- The same is possible for the event reporting service (PUS5)
- PUS Health Service added, which allows to command and retrieve health via PUS packets

### EnhancedControllerBase

- New base class for a controller which also implements HasActionsIF and HasLocalDataPoolIF

### Device Handler Base

- There is an additional `PERFORM_OPERATION` step for the device handler base. It is important
that DHB users adapt their polling sequence tables to perform this step. This steps allows for aclear distinction between operation and communication steps

### Events

- makeEvent function: Now takes three input parameters instead of two and
allows setting a unique ID. Event.cpp source file removed, functions now
defined in header directly. Namespaces renamed. Functions declared `constexpr`
now

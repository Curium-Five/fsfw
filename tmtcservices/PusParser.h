/**
 * @brief	This small helper class scans a given buffer for PUS packets.
 * 			Can be used if PUS packets are serialized in a tightly packed frame.
 * @details
 * The parser uses the payload length field of PUS packets to find
 * the respective PUS packet sizes.
 *
 * The parser parses a buffer by taking a pointer and the maximum size to scan.
 * If PUS packets are found, they are stored in a FIFO which stores pairs
 * consisting of the index in the buffer and the respective packet sizes.
 *
 * If the parser detects split packets (which means that the size of the
 * next packet is larger than the remaining size to scan), it can either
 * store that split packet or throw away the packet.

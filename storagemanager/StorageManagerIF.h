 * @brief	This class provides an interface for intermediate data storage.

 * 			write directly to the destination pointer.
 * 			For interprocess communication, the stores must be locked during
 * 			insertion and deletion. If the receiving storage identifier is
 * 			passed token-like between tasks, a lock during read and write
 * 			operations is not necessary.

## FSFW Testing

This folder contains testing and unit testing components.

### Instructions

The easiest way to run the unittest contained in this folder is to follow
the steps in the [test repository](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw_tests).
This is recommended even if the goal is to set up a custom test repository to have
a starting point.

To set up a custom test repository or project, following steps can be performed:

1. Copy the user folder content into the project root.
2. Clone [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) in the project root.
3. Use the `CMakeLists.txt` as a starting point to add tests and build the test
   executable.

 * 				It is prepared for use with plain old data types,
 * 				but may be extended to complex types if necessary.
 * 				It can be initialized with a certain value, size and validity flag.
 * 				It holds a pointer to the real data and offers methods to access this data and to acquire
 * 				additional information (such as validity and array/byte size).
 * 				It is NOT intended to be used outside the DataPool class.

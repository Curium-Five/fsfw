Class Ziemke, together with Bastian Bätz, started work on the code which would later become the Flight Software Framework in late 2009 as a student at the Institut für Raumfahrtsysteme at Universität Stuttgart.

"A dream would come true if the software framework I developed would be released in the public domain so that it can be used by other projects and to be used for teaching students how to program on-board software in the course of the studies at the IRS"
